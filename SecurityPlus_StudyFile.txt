Definition:           
	File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is the commonly used protocol for exchanging files over the Internet. FTP uses the Internet's TCP/IP protocols to enable data transfer. FTP uses a client-server architecture, often secured with SSL/TLS. FTP promotes sharing of files via remote computers with reliable and efficient data transfer.
	How FTP Works - FTP works in the same way as HTTP for transferring Web pages from a server to a user's browser and SMTP for transferring electronic mail across the Internet in that, like these technologies. FTP uses a client-server architecture. Users provide authentication using a sign-in protocol, usually a username and password, however some FTP servers may be configured to accept anonymous FTP logins where you don't need to identify yourself before accessing files. Most often, FTP is secured with SSL/TLS.
	How to FTP - Files can be transferred between two computers using FTP software. The user's computer is called the local host machine and is connected to the Internet. The second machine, called the remote host, is also running FTP software and connected to the Internet
***The local host machine connects to the remote host's IP address.
***The user would enter a username/password (or use anonymous).
***FTP software may have a GUI, allowing users to drag and drop files between the remote and local host. If not, a series of FTP commands are used to log in to the remote host and transfer files between the machines.
	Common Uses of FTP - FTP is most commonly used to download a file from a server using the Internet or to upload a file to a server (e.g., uploading a web page file to a Web server).

Definition:           
	Developed by SSH Communications Security Ltd., Secure Shell is a program to log into another computer over a network, to execute commands in a remote machine, and to move files from one machine to another. It provides strong authenticationand secure communications over insecure channels. It is a replacement for rlogin, rsh, rcp, and rdist.
	SSH protects a network from attacks such as IP spoofing, IP source routing, and DNS spoofing. An attacker who has managed to take over a network can only force ssh to disconnect. He or she cannot play back the traffic or hijack the connection when encryption is enabled.
	When using ssh's slogin (instead of rlogin) the entire login session, including transmission of password, is encrypted; therefore it is almost impossible for an outsider to collect passwords.
	SSH is available for Windows, Unix, Macintosh, and OS/2, and it also works with RSAauthentication.

TCP/UDP:     TCP/IP
Definition:           
Telnet is a terminal emulation program for TCP/IP networks such as the Internet. The Telnet program runs on your computer and connects your PC to a server on the network. You can then enter commands through the Telnet program and they will be executed as if you were entering them directly on the server console. This enables you to control the server and communicate with other servers on the network. To start a Telnet session, you must log in to a server by entering a valid username and password. Telnet is a common way to remotely control Web servers.
	The Telnet protocol is designed to provide a bi-directional, eight-bit byte oriented communications facility to allow for a a standard method of interfacing terminal devices and processes. Additional information on the Telnet protocol specification can be found

Definition:           
	Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, a protocol for sending e-mail messages between servers. Most e-mail systems that send mail over the Internet use SMTP to send messages from one server to another; the messages can then be retrieved with an e-mail client using either POP or IMAP. In addition, SMTP is generally used to send messages from a mail client to a mail server. This is why you need to specify both the POP or IMAP server and the SMTP server when you configure your e-mail application.

Definition:           
	An Internet service that translates domain names into IP addresses. Because domain names are alphabetic, they're easier to remember. The Internet however, is really based on IP addresses. Every time you use a domain name, therefore, a DNS service must translate the name into the corresponding IP address. For example, the domain name www.example.com might translate to 198.105.232.4.
	
The DNS system is, in fact, its own network. If one DNS server doesn't know how to translate a particular domain name, it asks another one, and so on, until the correct IP address is returned.

Acronym:     HTTP
Title:           HyperText Transfer Protocol
Port:           80
Protocol:      -
TCP/UDP:     HTTP is a protocol
Definition:           
HTTP is the underlying protocol used by the World Wide Web and this protocol defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and what actions Web servers and browsers should take in response to various commands.
	For example, when you enter a URL in your browser, this actually sends an HTTP command to the Web server directing it to fetch and transmit the requested Web page. The other main standard that controls how the World Wide Web works is HTML, which covers how Web pages are formatted and displayed.
	HTTP is called a stateless protocol because each command is executed independently, without any knowledge of the commands that came before it. This is the main reason that it is difficult to implement Web sites that react intelligently to user input. This shortcoming of HTTP is being addressed in a number of new technologies, including ActiveX, Java, JavaScript and cookies.
	Errors on the Internet can be quite frustrating - especially if you do not know the difference between a 404 error and a 502 error. These error messages, also called HTTP status codes are response codes given by Web servers and help identify the cause of the problem.
For example, "404 File Not Found" is a common HTTP status code. It means the Web server cannot find the file you requested. This means the webpage or other document you tried to load in your Web browser has either been moved or deleted, or you entered the wrong URL or document name.
	Knowing the meaning of the HTTP status code can help you figure out what went wrong. On a 404 error, for example, you could look at the URL to see if a word looks misspelled, then correct it and try it again. If that doesn't work, backtrack by deleting information between each backslash, until you come to a page on that site that isn't a 404. From there you may be able to find the page you're looking for.
	Many websites create custom 404 error pages that will help users locate a valid page or document within the website. For example, if you land on a 404 File Not Found page via Webopedia.com, a custom error page will load providing quick links to on-site navigation and site search features to help you find what you were looking for.
	What about HTTPS? - A similar abbreviation, HTTPS means Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure. Basically, it is the secure version of HTTP. Communications between the browser and website are encrypted by Transport Layer Security (TLS), or its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).

It drew roots from many sources: the languages LISP and ALGOL 60, and theoretical ideas from Peter J. Landin. It used an incremental compiler, which gave it some of the flexibility of an interpreted language, including allowing new function definitions at run time and modification of function definitions while a program was running (both of which are features of dynamic compilation), without the overhead of an interpreted language.

TCP/UDP:     -
Definition:           	FTP, or "File Transfer Protocol" is a popular method of transferring files between two remote systems.
	SFTP, which stands for SSH File Transfer Protocol, or Secure File Transfer Protocol, is a separate protocol packaged with SSH that works in a similar way over a secure connection. The advantage is the ability to leverage a secure connection to transfer files and traverse the filesystem on both the local and remote system.

    In almost all cases, SFTP is preferable to FTP because of its underlying security features and ability to piggy-back on an SSH connection. FTP is an insecure protocol that should only be used in limited cases or on networks you trust.

TCP/UDP:     -
Definition:           	Internet Relay Chat, a chat system developed by Jarkko Oikarinen in Finland in the late 1980s. IRC has become very popular as more people get connected to the Internet because it enables people connected anywhere on the Internet to join in live discussions. Unlike older chat systems, IRC is not limited to just two participants.
	To join an IRC discussion, you need an IRC client and Internet access. The IRC client is a program that runs on your computer and sends and receives messages to and from an IRC server. The IRC server, in turn, is responsible for making sure that all messages are broadcast to everyone participating in a discussion. There can be many discussions going on at once; each one is assigned a unique channel.

Title:           Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
Port:           389
Protocol:      -
TCP/UDP:     -
Definition:           	Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, a set of protocols for accessing information directories. LDAP is based on the standards contained within the X.500 standard, but is significantly simpler. And unlike X.500, LDAP supports TCP/IP, which is necessary for any type of Internet access. Because it's a simpler version of X.500, LDAP is sometimes called X.500-lite.

	Although not yet widely implemented, LDAP should eventually make it possible for almost any application running on virtually any computer platform to obtain directory information, such as email addresses and public keys. Because LDAP is an open protocol, applications need not worry about the type of server hosting the directory.

Definition:           Secure HTTP (S-HTTP)
	Another protocol for transmitting data securely over the World Wide Web is Secure HTTP (S-HTTP). Whereas SSL creates a secure connection between a client and a server, over which any amount of data can be sent securely, S-HTTP is designed to transmit individual messages securely. SSL and S-HTTP, therefore, can be seen as complementary rather than competing technologies. Both protocols were approved by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as a standard. (NOTE See SSL)

Protocol:      -
TCP/UDP:     -
Definition:           	Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a client/server protocol that automatically provides an Internet Protocol (IP) host with its IP address and other related configuration information such as the subnet mask and default gateway. RFCs 2131 and 2132 define DHCP as an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standard based on Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP), a protocol with which DHCP shares many implementation details. DHCP allows hosts to obtain required TCP/IP configuration information from a DHCP server.
	Windows Server 2008 includes the DHCP Server service, which is an optional networking component. All Windows-based clients include the DHCP client as part of TCP/IP, including Windows Vista, the Windows Server 2003 operating system, the Windows XP Professional operating system, Microsoft Windows2000 Professional operating system, Microsoft Windows NT Workstation4.0 operating system, Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition operating system, and the Microsoft Windows98 operating system.

Protocol:      -
TCP/UDP:     -
Definition:           A device or software that monitors the network for unauthorized access, malicious activity, or malware. Any incident that is registered is used to notify administrators and is often collected and stored centrally using the (SIEM) system. There is a wide spectrum of IDS including Network Intrusion Detection-NID and Host-Based Intrusion Detection-HIDS.
	Most often, IDS detection is based on known signitures, or malicious network traffic patterns. Recognition is often reffered to the Intrusion Prevention System. IDS is similar to a firewall, but a firewall monitors external traffic and prevents it from getting in; while an IDS monitors often internal, suspected intruders after they have triggered an alarm.

Definition:           a. Signature Based Match _ does this code coming over the network match known malware. The photo below shows a known
signature of a malware worm. Regardless of the situation, if this hexadecimal signature is detected anywhere, we know what it is and to prevent it.
b. Anomaly Based Detection
    i. We build a baseline on what we think is normal in all situations. Do we have bandwidth spikes? Do we have too many people trying to log on?
c. Behavior Based
    i. Does a specific individual log on and try to access something that they do not normally access?
d. Heuristics
    i. Use Artificial intelligence to identify.
    ii. See a type of traffic flow come into the network, and see if it changes. Does this traffic contain good or bad packets? AI can keep learning.
A signature match is black and white, while Heuristics is ever changing and adapting to new situations and new users
