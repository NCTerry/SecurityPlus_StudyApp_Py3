Acronym:     FTP-123
Title:           File Transfer Protocol-123
Port:           21-123
Protocol:      N/A -123
TCP_UDP:     TCP-123
Definition:           123 - The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used for the transfer of computer files between a client and server on a computer network.FTP is built on a client-server model architecture and uses separate control and data connections between the client and the server. FTP users may authenticate themselves with a clear-text sign-in protocol, normally in the form of a username and password, but can connect anonymously if the server is configured to allow it. For secure transmission that protects the username and password, and encrypts the content, FTP is often secured with SSL/TLS (FTPS). SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) is sometimes also used instead; it is technologically different. The first FTP client applications were command-line programs developed before operating systems had graphical user interfaces, and are still shipped with most Windows, Unix, and Linux operating systems. Many FTP clients and automation utilities have since been developed for desktops, servers, mobile devices, and hardware, and FTP has been incorporated into productivity applications, such as web page editors.

Acronym:     SSH
Title:           Secure Shell
Port:           N/A
Protocol:      N/A
TCP/UDP:     N/A
Definition:           SSH, also known as Secure Socket Shell, is a network protocol that provides administrators with a secure way to access a remote computer. SSH also refers to the suite of utilities that implement the protocol. Secure Shell provides strong authentication and secure encrypted data communications between two computers connecting over an insecure network such as the Internet. SSH is widely used by network administrators for managing systems and applications remotely, allowing them to log in to another computer over a network, execute commands and move files from one computer to another.SSH can refer both to the cryptographic network protocol and to the suite of utilities that implement that protocol. SSH uses the client-server model, connecting a secure shell client application, the end at which the session is displayed, with an SSH server, the end at which the session runs.Apart from Microsoft Windows, SSH software is included by default on most operating systems. SSH also supports tunneling, forwarding arbitrary TCP ports and X11 connections while file transfer can be accomplished using the associated secure file transfer or secure copy (SCP) protocols. An SSH server, by default, listens on the standard TCP port 22.The SSH suite comprises three utilities: slogin, ssh and scp; that are secure versions of the earlier insecure UNIX utilities, rlogin, rsh, and rcp. SSH uses public-key cryptography to authenticate the remote computer and allow the remote computer to authenticate the user, if necessary.
