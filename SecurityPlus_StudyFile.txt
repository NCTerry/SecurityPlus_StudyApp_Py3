TCP/UDP:     -
Definition:               b.	If you hear Layer 2 = Switch
    c.	If you hear Layer 3 = Router
    d.	Routers can connect diverse network types: LAN, WAN, Copper, Fiber.
    e.	If you see a 90-Degree symbol, it is likely referring to the router.
    f.	Routers do not make a good firewall.

Title:           Firewalls
Port:           -
Protocol:      No Pro
TCP/UDP:     -
Definition:           1.	Firewall _ Layer 4 TCPUDP
    a.	Technically it can be the layer 3 router acting as the firewall.
    b.	Some do filter through layer 7.
    c.	Usually sits on the ingress/egress of the network.
    d.	Can encrypt traffic into/out of the network, to protect traffic between sites.
    e.	Firewall can act as a proxy. Traditional method to separate internal networks from internet. Talking to the proxy, instead of the internet. The proxy takes your request and sends to the internet.

Protocol:      -
TCP/UDP:     -
Definition:           
a.	Distribute traffic from the internet to a cluster of private servers. When I contact Google, they have many servers across the world that I may be interacting with.
b.	Servers may be distributed based on what they have to offer, pictures, videos, maps, regions. The load balancer needs to be able to distribute based on the content, and/or the load.
c.	The servers may have all the same stuff, but if you send too many users to one, it can be overused.
d.	All servers need to have the proper security updates.

a.	AKA - Web Security Gateway  This is an all-in-one security appliance.
b.	Will have:
    i.	URL Filter _ Site content inspection. Is this porn?
    ii.	Malware Inspection
    iii.	Spam Filter
    iv.	CSU/DSU
    v.	Router/Switch Attached
    vi.	Firewall Attached
    vii.	IDS/IPS
    viii.	Bandwidth Shaper _ Limit people in your network who are watching YouTube videos.

Acronym:     NIPS  ||  NIDS
Title:           Network Intrusion Prevension  ||  Detection
Port:           -
Protocol:      -
TCP/UDP:     -
Definition:           
a.	System built to watch the traffic and check for vulnerabilities/threats.
b.	Check for:
    i.	Buffer overflows
    ii.	Cross Site Scripting
    iii.	etc
c.	Detection vs Prevention
    i.	Detection > alarm or alert
    ii.	Prevention > Stop it before it gets into the network.
1.	If you are preventing, you need to make sure that you are not also preventing legitimate traffic.

TCP/UDP:     -
Definition:           
a.	Signature Based Match _ does this code coming over the network match known malware. The photo below shows a known signature of a malware worm. Regardless of the situation, if this hexadecimal signature is detected anywhere, we know what it is and to prevent it.
b.	Anomaly Based Detection
    i.	We build a baseline on what we think is normal in all situations. Do we have bandwidth spikes? Do we have too many people trying to log on?
c.	Behavior Based
    i.	Does a specific individual log on and try to access something that they do not normally access?
d.	Heuristics
    i.	Use Artificial intelligence to identify.
    ii.	See a type of traffic flow come into the network, and see if it changes. Does this traffic contain good or bad packets? AI can keep learning.
A signature match is black and white, while Heuristics is ever changing and adapting to new situations and new users
